#' Impulsivity data on various subjects
#' Shen, Lee & Chen (2016) investigated the neural correlates of impulse control of individuals who scored either high or low on an impulsiveness scale. Twelve participants (out of a sample of 305) were classified as having a high impulsivity trait. Another 12 participants were of low impulsivity trait.
#' The study used a stop-signal task to measure people’s ability to inhibit a response on demand. Participants, wearing a device for measuring electroencephalogram (EEG), were presented with a series of the letter ‘A’ or ‘B’ on a computer screen. They were asked to press the left button for ‘A’ and the right button for ‘B’. Over a run of 128 trials, each letter appears 50% of the time. Each run of the experiments consisted of 96 ‘Go’ trials and 32 ‘Stop’ trials. The order of trials is randomized in a run.
#' At each ‘Go’ trial, a fixation cross appeared first at the center of the screen for 150 milliseconds (ms), followed by the letter (the ‘Go’ stimulus) for 150 ms, and then a blank screen varying from 800 to 1100 ms. At each ‘Stop’ trial, the letter was followed by the letter ‘S’ (the ‘stop’ signal) at a varying schedule at random (200, 300, 400 or 500 ms each 25% of the time) and the participants were required to withhold button-pressing until the trial expires. Participants either succeeded or failed in this response inhibition condition.
#' For each subject in the two impulvisity trait groups, the amplitude of ERP at each time point of measurement was averaged over trials of either failed or successful response inhibition. The time-locked EEG measurements recorded from 30 scalp locations (channels) were available as a data frame object, ‘impulsivity’, in the Fanova R package.
#' By treating the mean ERP curve as the unit of observation, a two between-subjects (impulsivity trait, low vs high) by two within-subjects (response inhibition, failed or successful) factorial design is obtained at each electrode location.
